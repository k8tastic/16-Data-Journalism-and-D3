          <h2><a href="https://www.debt.org/faqs/americans-in-debt/poverty-united-states/">Poverty and Health</a></h2>
          <p>Health is also strongly related to income. Poor people have higher mortality rates, a higher prevalence of
            acute or chronic diseases and more emotional and behavioral issues.</p>

          <p>According to a 2011 report issued by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging:
            <ul>
              <li>People in the highest income group live an average of 6.5 years longer than those in the lowest income
                group.</li>
              <li>The mortality rate for African-American infants is double that of white infants.</li>
              <li>Poor adults are twice as likely to have diabetes as affluent adults.</li>
              <li>Poor children are twice as likely to have unhealthy levels of lead in their blood than other children.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>The face of poverty for most Americans is pictures of families in rundown housing in large cities where the
            industry has moved away.

            The true face of poverty, however, is found in rural areas of the South and Southwest regions of the U.S.
            where living conditions are even more run down and industry never really started up.</p>

          <p>Seven of the 10 states with the highest poverty rates in the U.S. are in the South. That includes
            Mississippi (20.8% of population below the poverty line); Louisiana (20%), Kentucky (18.5%), West Virginia
            (17.9%), Arkansas (17.2%), Alabama (17.1%) and Georgia (16%) lead the way.</p>

          <p>These areas have a long history of poverty and there are many factors contributing to it, but the most
            obvious are that they were agricultural economies first and foremost with light emphasis on education and
            innovation.</p>

          <h2><a
              href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/05/01/why-are-southerners-less-healthy/?utm_term=.11b9a8fa98c2">Why
              are Southerners less healthy?</a></h2>
          <p>The South has long been the Land of Unhealthful Habits, a region with states that often lead the nation in
            some of the least desirable categories, such as obesity and smoking.
            <p>The Southeastern states "are collectively home to the highest number of preventable deaths for
              each of the five leading causes" of mortality.</p>

            <p>Specifically, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and
              Tennessee
              are national leaders in preventable deaths from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease,
              cerebrovascular disease (strokes) and unintentional injuries (such as car and motorcycle accidents).</p>
              <p>As for why Southerners are less healthy than people in many other parts of the U.S., well, that is a
              complex
              question. Southerners are poorer than residents in the rest of the U.S., do have a certain fondness for
              fried food, (even if that is exaggerated), exercise less and drive more.</p>

            <p>Southerners are less likely to have health insurance or access to the health care they need. A Gallup
              poll
              issued a few years back showed that residents of the region visit the dentist less often, probably because
              they are poorer.</p>

            <p>Despite these facts, many Southern states did not choose to expand Medicaid health coverage for the poor
              as
              part of the Affordable Care Act, which, that same Kaiser report says, could give insurance to millions
              more
              people.
